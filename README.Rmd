# trailcover

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of trailcover is to allow you to easily compare your tracks (gpx created by your physical walking, running, hiking, etc.) with official trails. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of trailcover from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("monkeywithacupcake/trailcover")
```

## Current State

transferring over functions from outside_oly - if you already mostly know how to use sf and r, feel free to try those functions.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(trailcover)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
